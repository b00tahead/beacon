## üé® Design Principles

### Accessibility First
Every component is built with accessibility as a core requirement, not an afterthought:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper ARIA labeling and descriptions
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Touch target compliance (44px mobile, 32px desktop)
- Screen reader optimization

### Consistent Design Language
- **4px grid system** for predictable spacing and alignment
- **Semantic color tokens** for consistent theming
- **Typography scale** that pairs with the grid system
- **Component variants** that maintain visual hierarchy

### Developer Experience
- **TypeScript first** with comprehensive type definitions
- **Composable APIs** that follow React best practices
- **Consistent prop patterns** across all components
- **Excellent documentation** with live examples

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript** for the component library
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1+** for styling with custom design tokens
- **Vite 7** for fast development and building
- **Storybook 9** for component documentation and testing
- **Vitest + Playwright** for browser-based testing
- **ESLint 9** with TypeScript support for code quality

## üìö Documentation

Visit the Storybook documentation to explore components, view accessibility demonstrations, and see live examples:

```bash
npm run storybook

### Key Documentation Sections

- **Foundations**: Colors, typography, spacing, and accessibility features
- **Components**: Interactive examples with all variants and states
- **Accessibility Demos**: WCAG 2.2 compliance demonstrations
- **Design Tokens**: Available CSS custom properties and Tailwind classes

## üß™ Testing

The project uses a comprehensive testing strategy:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Build and validate
npm run build

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

- **Browser Testing**: Vitest with Playwright for real browser environments
- **Accessibility Testing**: Automated a11y testing in Storybook
- **Visual Regression**: Storybook stories serve as visual tests
- **Type Checking**: Full TypeScript validation

## ü§ù Contributing

### Development Workflow

1. **Component Development**: Follow the established patterns in existing components
2. **Accessibility Testing**: Use Storybook's accessibility addon to validate compliance
3. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive stories with accessibility demos
4. **Testing**: Ensure all tests pass and new components have proper coverage
