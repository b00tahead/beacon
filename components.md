# Design System Checklist

## Core Components

Components are the main building blocks for user interfaces. Building a reusable component library enhances your product development workflow by reducing design and tech debt and speeding up the process. Core components can't be broken down into granular pieces without losing their meaning.

## Accordion (0/4)

Accordion toggles the visibility of content regions when the trigger element gets pressed.

### Active state

Accordion comes in two states for toggling its content visibility. If an accordion trigger displays an icon, it should be visually distinct between states.

### Composition

Content area should be flexible enough to support various types of content, including other components.

### Toggle transition

Add a subtle animation to help users understand and follow the component behavior when switching between states.

### Content and trigger relation

Focusing the content area with assistive technologies should announce additional context from the trigger element.

---

## Alert (0/6)

Alert displays a prominent message about the whole page or its specific area.

### Colors

It's crucial to differentiate the alert's visual appearance based on its role. If you're using background colors for role differentiation, ensure there's enough contrast ratio with the content displayed inside the alert.

### Title support

Supporting a title can help your user understand the context of the message faster for longer alert messages.

### Icon support

Icon illustrates the role of the alert and provides an additional hint about it for colorblind people.

### Supplementary actions

Actions in the alert should relate to their text and provide a way to react to the message sent to the user.

### Responsiveness

Alert can adapt to the viewport size, usually becoming full-width for mobile to save some space.

### Accessibility roles

When using assistive technologies, alerts should announce their accessibility role correctly.

## Avatar (0/7)

Thumbnail of a user photo, organization, or a visual representation of other types of content.

### Image

Avatars should mask an image into their shape and work with any image size since they may get this image from unknown data sources.

### Image fallback

When not passing an image or there is an image loading error, avatars should be able to show a fallback with a different image, icon, or text initials.

### Sizes

There are many contexts to use an avatar, which require different sizes for the component. Use at least 2-3 different sizes for average projects and ensure there's at least a small size available.

### Colors

A background color should be applied to the avatar shape when used without an image. Make sure that icons and text have enough contrast ratio with the background according to the WCAG AA standard.

### Shape

Avatars might support multiple shapes, like square or circle, based on the area they are used in.

### Avatar groups

Multiple avatars can be stacked together to represent a group of users.

### Accessibility label

Avatar should provide an accessibility label when used for non-decorative images and has no text representation of its contents.

## Badge (0/7)

Compact element that represents the status of an object or user input.

### Colors

Badges may play various roles in your product, and having a predefined color for each role should help users understand their meaning. When changing colors, make sure the text has enough contrast ratio with the background according to the WCAG AA standard.

### Variants

Based on where in the product badges are rendered, you might support multiple component variants. For example, you can have some badges using a faded background to avoid drawing too much attention.

### Sizes

Badges can come in multiple sizes depending on where a badge is used. For example, you can use the large size for marketing pages.

### Icon support

To better illustrate the meaning of a badge, you can display an icon next to the text. Make sure that for small badges, icon contents are still recognizable.

### Dismissible action

Badges can be used as a dynamic way to display selected values, and there should be a way to dismiss them.

### Empty state

Badges can be used without any text content inside. That usually requires changing their styles to preserve the correct shape.

### Positioning

When used as a status badge, like a notification indicator â€“ you should be able to position it relative to those elements.

## Button (0/10)

Interactive element used for single-step actions.

### Colors

Buttons may play various roles in your product, and having a predefined color for each role should help users understand their meaning. When changing colors, make sure the text has enough contrast ratio with the background according to the WCAG AA standard.

### Variants

When using multiple buttons, there should be a way to differentiate between primary and secondary actions. Buttons may play different roles for the user or be used on various surfaces, and they have to change how they look.

### Sizes

Depending on where a button will be used, it can come in multiple sizes. For example, you can use the small size for dense areas of your application.

### Icon support

Icons easily communicate the button's purpose when used next to its label or can be used without text when there's insufficient space. Ensure the accessibility label is provided when used with an icon only.

### Hover state

Clearly show that the button is interactive when hovered with a mouse cursor.

### Active state

Provide a visual cue when a button is pressed, used for selecting a value, or toggles other elements on the page.

### Loading state

Indicate when users have to wait for the result of their action after pressing a button. If a spinner is used to display this state, ensure it's not changing the original button width or height.

### Disabled state

Visually shows that the button is not interactive and restricts it from being pressed.

### Accessibility role

Button should correctly announce the button or link accessibility roles and automatically resolve it based on the properties passed to it.

### Focus indicator

Button should have a visible focus indicator when it's focused using the keyboard or assistive technologies.
