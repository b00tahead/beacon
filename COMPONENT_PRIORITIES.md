# Beacon Component Development Priorities

## Priority Tier 1: Foundation Components (Build First)
**These are the building blocks that other components depend on**

1. **Icon** - Required by almost every other component for accessibility and visual communication
2. **Button** - Core interactive element, used across forms, navigation, actions
3. **Link** - Fundamental navigation element, accessibility critical
4. **Divider** - Simple layout component used for visual separation
5. **Loading Indicator** - Essential for async operations and user feedback

## Priority Tier 2: Form & Input Components (Build Second)
**Critical for user interaction and data collection**

6. **Text Field** - Foundation of most forms, high accessibility requirements
7. **Checkbox** - Essential form control with complex accessibility needs
8. **Input Radio** - Core form selection, often used with checkbox
9. **Switch** - Toggle control, simpler than checkbox but related
10. **Select** - Complex dropdown form control
11. **Text Area** - Multi-line text input

## Priority Tier 3: Feedback & Communication (Build Third)
**User feedback and status communication**

12. **Alert** - Critical for error states and system feedback
13. **Toast** - Non-blocking notifications
14. **Progress Bar** - User feedback for long operations
15. **Badge** - Status indicators and counts

## Priority Tier 4: Layout & Navigation (Build Fourth)
**Structural components for organizing content**

16. **Card** - Container component used extensively
17. **List** - Fundamental content organization
18. **Breadcrumbs** - Navigation aid with accessibility importance
19. **Tabs** - Content organization with complex accessibility
20. **Modal** - Overlay component with focus management requirements

## Priority Tier 5: Complex Interactive (Build Fifth)
**More complex components with advanced interactions**

21. **Dropdown** - Complex interactive component with positioning
22. **Tooltip** - Contextual help with accessibility considerations
23. **Accordion** - Collapsible content with state management
24. **Pagination** - Complex navigation component

## Priority Tier 6: Advanced & Specialized (Build Last)
**Components for specific use cases**

25. **Calendar** - Complex date selection with internationalization
26. **Carousel** - Complex layout component with motion considerations
27. **Avatar** - User representation component
28. **Image** - Enhanced image component with accessibility features
29. **Skeleton** - Loading state representation

## Development Approach per Component

### Minimum Viable Component (MVC) Requirements:
1. **Semantic HTML** - Proper element selection (button, input, etc.)
2. **ARIA attributes** - Complete accessibility labeling
3. **Keyboard navigation** - Full keyboard interaction support
4. **Focus management** - Proper focus states and indicators
5. **Screen reader support** - Tested with assistive technologies
6. **Base styling** - Uses Beacon's design foundations
7. **TypeScript props** - Well-typed API with good DX
8. **Storybook stories** - All states and variants documented
9. **Basic tests** - Component rendering and interaction tests

### Component API Principles:
- **Minimal but flexible** - Essential props only, extensible
- **Accessibility by default** - No additional work needed for basic accessibility
- **Semantic naming** - Props named by function, not appearance
- **Required vs optional** - Clear distinction with sensible defaults
- **Composition friendly** - Works well with other components

### Documentation per Component:
- **Usage examples** - Common use cases with code
- **Accessibility notes** - How component supports accessibility
- **Do's and don'ts** - Clear guidance on proper usage
- **Keyboard interactions** - List of supported keyboard shortcuts
- **Screen reader behavior** - Expected announcements and navigation

## Build Order Rationale:

**Tier 1** components have no dependencies and are needed by everything else.
**Tier 2** components are critical for user input and have complex accessibility requirements.
**Tier 3** components handle user feedback and status communication.
**Tier 4** components organize and structure content.
**Tier 5** components have complex interactions and dependencies on earlier tiers.
**Tier 6** components are specialized for specific use cases.

This order ensures we can build and test each component thoroughly while having the dependencies available for proper integration testing.
